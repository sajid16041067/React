Blog Cat

It is a blogging web application.

Please visit- magical-crayon.surge.sh

I have used Reactjs to build this application. The basic advantage of reactjs is that we have different components that work individually and that is the power of reactjs.

I have made different components for-

Header Component
Home Component
New Blog Component
View Blog Component
Blog Component
Toast Component
Page Not Found Component

All these components are individual, independent and have their own state.

Redux-
    Since there is no database for storing blogs, and hence the blogs are stored in the redux store and managed by redux. I have used redux toolkit which is a popular library that helps in using redux.

Context API-
    I have used context API for showing the messages that popout known as Toast Notification.
